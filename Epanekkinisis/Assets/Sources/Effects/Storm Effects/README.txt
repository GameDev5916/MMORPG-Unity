Particle Collision

Non-mobile Rain and Snow Storm Effects contain particles that collide with the ground.
You must assign collision object(s) to the particle system in your scene.

To assign collision for particles in your scene:
- Load a Storm Effect into your scene
- Navigate to the Hierarchy tab and click the Storm Effect (for example: Snow Heavy)
- In the Inspector tab, notice there is a tab labeled Collision. Click on this tab to expand
- Notice the Planes area, click on the small grey round icon, choose a plane for collision from the list of choices

+Note: If you have more than one collision plane, click the black + icon in the collision tab to add more collision planes
-----------------------------------------------
Adjust Prewarm Settings

Rain, Snow, Tornado, and Wind have start delay settings to transition the effects from being off to on, over a few seconds.  
Depending on your needs, this may not be the desired effect.
If you prefer to begin the scene with the effect already playing, or prewarmed, see below.

To adjust Prewarm settings:
- Load a Storm Effect into your scene
- Navigate to the Hierarchy tab and click the Storm Effect
- In the Inspector tab, find the Prewarm setting and check the box

The Storm Effect will now instantly begin playing when the scene begins.
-----------------------------------------------
Adjust Color & Transparency Settings to Match Your Scene

Storm Effects were designed to look best with the Demo Scene included with the pack. 
You may need to adjust color and transparency settings to best match your scene.

- Load a Storm Effect into your scene
- Navigate to the Hierarchy tab and click the Storm Effect
- In the Inspector tab, find the Color over Lifetime and click the rectangular window to spawn the Gradient Editor window
- In the Gradient Editor window, click the small nodes on the top and bottom of the rectangle
- The top nodes control alpha transparency, the bottom nodes control color
-----------------------------------------------
Mix & Match

Storm Effects are designed to work together.

Try adding a few different types of prefabs to the scene.

For Example:
Rain Heavy + Clouds Stormy = More Fun! 
-----------------------------------------------

ENJOY!
