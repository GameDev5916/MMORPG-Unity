! IMPORTANT !

Most of the sky textures are initially imported as low-res 32x32 compressed format textures to hasten initial import time and save you disk space. Raise quality settings in the inspector as required.

ALLSKY


A palette of over one hundred skies. (117 in total)
 
For lighting artists, environment artists and indie developers looking for a wide suite of skies to light their environments.

Many weather and cloud types: Clear, overcast, summery, stormy, autumnal, hazy, epic, foggy, cumulus.  
 


 
TECHNICAL: 
Texture format: Each sky is a 3K equi-rectangular projection in PNG format. Unity then imports those textures as cube maps. 

Most of the sky textures are initially imported as low-res 32x32 compressed format textures to hasten initial import time and save you disk space. Raise quality settings in the inspector as required. 
 
Skies are sorted by time of day in folders.  
 
An example material is located in the AllSky root folder.  
 
Changing the sky is as simple as making a new material of the 'skybox cubed' type, assigning it a sky texture and setting it as your skybox via the scenes' render settings. 
 
Though the textures are not HDR, they do also load into the brilliant Marmoset Skyshop for use with its shaders!  

The screenshots in /ExampleUsage show some skies contained in this asset pack. Taken via a screen grab from Unity Pro 4.1, featuring simple terrain with careful use of ambience, a directional light, fog, and some camera effects.
