Camera Shake Changelog

************ Version 1.2.0 ************
Added a CancelShake overload that takes a time argument. This will immediately cancel all shakes and move the camera matrix back to its original position.
Small compatibility fix for future Unity versions.

************ Version 1.1.0 ************
Added shake rotation - works on both orthographic and perspective cameras.
Various performance fixes.

************ Version 1.0.2 ************
Critical matrix transformation bugfix. Please update!

************ Version 1.0.1 ************
Added support for multiple cameras.
NOTE: The GUI shake distance is based on the first camera in the camera list.

The camera matrix is adjusted directly instead of the local transform - moving cameras can now shake properly.

************ Version 1.0.0 ************
Initial version.
